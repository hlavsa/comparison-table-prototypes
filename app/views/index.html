        CAIT Comparison Table Prototypes
      </h1>

      <p>These options have gone through several iterations, according to the needs of the particular service we're working on. 

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Phase 2</h2>
      <p>For Phase 2, we decided that Options 1 and 4 were the most appropriate for our particular use case, but that we liked some of the benefits of Option 3. So we've tried to combine the best bits of those options.</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-one-v2">Option 1 - Responsive Plain Table</a></h3>
        <p>In this iteration, we drew from the Design System's Tab pattern. We liked that accordions allowed you to switch between different groups of information on mobile, but found it didn't work on desktop. So this pulls across the 'Table of Contents' from the Tab component, on mobile, as a quick way of navigating between content.</p></li>

        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-four-v2">Option 4 - Unresponsive Scroll Table</a></h3>
        <p>We've kept this one broadly the same as the previous version, aside from adjusting the table headers to make them links.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Phase 1</h2>
      <p>In this phase, I took existing patterns and tables that others across government had already created and used them as a base. Reference list is at the bottom of the page.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-one">Option 1 - Responsive Plain Table</a></h3>
        <p>This example is responsive but doesn't have the ability to expand content out on mobile.</p></li>

        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-two">Option 2 - Responsive Details Table</a></h3>
        <p>This option is responsive, and allows you to hide and expand content using the Design System details component</p></li>

        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-three">Option 3 - Responsive Accordion Table</a></h3>
        <p>This table is responsive, and allows you to hide and expand content using the Design System accordion component</p></li>

        <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="./table-four">Option 4 - Unresponsive Scroll Table</a></h3>
        <p>This table is responsive, and allows you to hide and expand content using the Design System accordion component</p></li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Inspiration and Research</h2>
      <p>Ideas and inspiration from these prototypes have been taken from the following resources, many of which were shared in the cross-government front-end slack channel:</p>

      <ul>
